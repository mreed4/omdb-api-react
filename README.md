# omdb-api-react

This started as an endeavor to rebuild or re-create the page for OMDb API to a React SPA. I think the original as it is now was built using Bootstrap--which is quite dated. 

Specifically, I wanted to focus on the use of `react-router-dom`. I accomplished this goal, then decided to (1) redesign the site aesthetically, and (2) simplify and restructure the site. 

I'm not the strongerst designer, but I wanted the use of yellow to be very bold, as it ties the site to the yellow from the IMDB logo.

This was a pet project for the purpsoe of practicing my React skill and design skill. I don't necessarily intend to ask the creator of OMDb API if he would be interested in using the design.
